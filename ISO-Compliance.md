## Introduction

This document outlines the ISO 27001 framework tailored for an AI-generated targeted ad system that integrates multiple data sources. The framework ensures the protection of information assets, minimises security risks, and complies with international information security standards.

## Organisational Context

### Internal Context

The internal context refers to the organisational environment in which the ISMS operates, including:

- Organisational Structure : A technology company specialising in AI-driven advertising solutions.
- Information Assets : User data (email content, search history, video watch history, music playlists), AI models, and ad-serving platforms.
- Stakeholders : Employees, management, data scientists, advertisers, and users.
- Internal Processes : Data ingestion, processing, model training, ad generation, ad serving, and performance tracking.
- Technologies : Cloud-based infrastructure, AI/ML algorithms, secure APIs, and encryption technologies.

### External Context

The external context involves factors outside the organisation that impact the ISMS, including:

- Regulatory Requirements : GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and emerging AI regulations.
- Market Forces : Competitors, industry standards, and customer expectations for privacy and security.
- External Threats : Cyberattacks (e.g., DDoS, data breaches, adversarial AI attacks), legal challenges, and technological advancements.
- Partnerships : Collaborations with cloud providers, ad networks, and regulatory bodies.

## Scope of the ISMS

The scope of the ISMS includes all processes, systems, and assets involved in the collection, processing, and use of data for AI-driven targeted advertising. It encompasses:

- Data Ingestion Systems 
- Data Processing Pipelines 
- AI/ML Model Training 
- Ad Content Generation 
- Ad Serving Platforms 
- Performance Tracking Systems 
- Support Infrastructure  (e.g., databases, APIs, cloud services)

The ISMS will apply to all employees, contractors, and third-party service providers who interact with these systems.

## Information Security Risk Assessment

### Risk Identification

Risks are identified based on the data lifecycle and the potential threats at each stage. This includes:

- Data Ingestion : Risks of data breaches, unauthorised access, and interception during data transfer.
- Data Processing : Risks of data corruption, unauthorised data manipulation, and leakage of sensitive information.
- Model Training : Risks of model poisoning, data privacy violations, and exposure of proprietary algorithms.
- Ad Content Generation : Risks of non-compliance with regulations, generation of inappropriate content, and manipulation of ad outcomes.
- Ad Serving : Risks of click fraud, DDoS attacks, and data leaks during ad delivery.
- Performance Tracking : Risks of tampered analytics, unauthorised access to performance data, and loss of data integrity.

# Risk Analysis and Evaluation

## Risk Matrix

Risks are evaluated based on their likelihood and potential impact. The following risk matrix is used:

| Likelihood | Impact  | Risk Level |
|------------|---------|------------|
| High       | High    | Critical   |
| High       | Medium  | High       |
| Medium     | High    | High       |
| Medium     | Medium  | Medium     |
| Low        | High    | Medium     |
| Low        | Medium  | Low        |
| Low        | Low     | Low        |

## Risk Treatment

Risks are treated using one of the following strategies:

-  Mitigation : Implementing controls to reduce the risk’s likelihood or impact.
-  Acceptance : Accepting the risk if it falls within the organi sation’s risk tolerance.
-  Avoidance : Changing the process to eliminate the risk entirely.
-  Transfer : Outsourcing or insuring against the risk.

# Information Security Objectives

The information security objectives are aligned with the organi sation’s mission to provide secure, reliable, and compliant AI-driven ad solutions. These objectives include:

1.  Protect User Data : Ensure all user data is encrypted, anonymi sed, and processed securely.
2.  Ensure Compliance : Maintain compliance with all relevant data protection regulations and industry standards.
3.  Enhance System Resilience : Implement robust security measures to prevent and mitigate cyberattacks.
4.  Promote Security Awareness : Provide regular training and updates to all employees on security best practices.
5.  Monitor and Improve : Continuously monitor security controls and improve the ISMS based on emerging threats and technological advancements.

# Control Implementation

## Annex A Controls

ISO 27001 Annex A provides a set of controls that can be implemented to address identified risks. Relevant controls for this system include:

-  A.5 Information Security Policies : Define and implement a robust information security policy.
-  A.6 Organi sation of Information Security : Assign roles and responsibilities for security management.
-  A.8 Asset Management : Ensure all information assets are inventoried and classified based on sensitivity.
-  A.9 Access Control : Implement role-based access control and multi-factor authentication.
-  A.10 Cryptography : Use encryption to protect data at rest and in transit.
-  A.12 Operations Security : Monitor and log all operations for security anomalies.
-  A.14 System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance : Ensure security is integrated into the system development lifecycle.
-  A.16 Information Security Incident Management : Develop and maintain an incident response plan.

## Risk Treatment Plan

The Risk Treatment Plan outlines how each identified risk will be addressed. It includes the following elements:

-  Risk Description : A brief description of the risk.
-  Chosen Treatment : The strategy selected to address the risk (e.g., mitigation, acceptance).
-  Control Measures : Specific controls implemented to treat the risk.
-  Responsible Parties : Individuals or teams responsible for implementing the controls.
-  Timeline : Expected completion date for implementing the controls.
