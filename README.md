# AI-Generated Targeted Ad System

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation and conceptual models for implementing ISO 27001 compliance in an AI-generated targeted ad system. The system integrates multiple data sources, including email, internet search history, video watch history, and music playlist history, to deliver personalised ads through an ad server platform. The primary objective is to protect information assets, minimise security risks, and ensure compliance with international information security standards.

## Contents

- ISO 27001 Compliance Documentation : Detailed documentation covering the organisational context, scope of the ISMS, risk assessment, information security objectives, and control implementation. This document also includes conceptual diagrams and risk treatment plans.
- Security Concerns and State Diagrams : Analysis of potential security concerns, state diagrams, and strategies to minimise the attack surface while safeguarding data and enabling collaboration.
- Conceptual Diagrams : Diagrams illustrating the ISMS framework, data lifecycle, and associated security controls.
- Risk Assessment and Treatment Tables : Tables that outline identified risks, their likelihood, impact, and the treatment strategies employed to mitigate them.

## Key Features

- Risk Management : Comprehensive risk assessment and treatment plan, ensuring all aspects of the system's security are addressed.
- Control Implementation : A set of controls derived from ISO 27001 Annex A, tailored to the specific needs of the AI-generated targeted ad system.
- Compliance and Resilience : The system is designed to comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations, while also enhancing system resilience against cyberattacks.
